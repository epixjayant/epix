#epixcoding
This is an interactive learning platform project, inspired from edclub.com which teach touch typing, i like the way how someone can learn touchtyping, so on this platform the main goal is to teach everything in the same structured manner with live interactive way and with the pace of learners together.
so my first goal is to create a terminal-mastery course from scrach. this course will make a learner super user of command-line and they can automate their daily repeatating stuff.
